# === MMV backend runtime deps ===
# Keep this file small: list only the packages you import directly.
# Flask will bring its own compatible transitive deps (Werkzeug, Jinja2, etc).

Flask~=3.1          # Web framework (routing, request/response, dev server)
flask-cors~=4.0     # CORS headers so the React/Vite frontend can call the API
numpy~=2.3          # Vectorized simulation math (positions, velocities, histograms)

# this file is just a list of the backend's direct Python dependencies.
# inside are only the core packages we actually import:
# - Flask for the web server and routes
# - flask-cors for allowing frontend requests
# - numpy for the molecule simulation math



# Once backend is fully done run this: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
